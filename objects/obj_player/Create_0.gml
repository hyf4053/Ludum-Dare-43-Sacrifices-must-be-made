	"When we have a better world.",
	"I can't remember how long has it been since then... At that time, we owned almost all we want.",

	"I used to be a worker... Not so fun, eh? But believe me, I was found of that.",
	"I have my wife, my dear daughter, and our cute cat. It's a lazy cat, but is even more hardworking than me sometimes.",
	"But one day, when I woke up in the morning, something changes, I mean, slowly changes.",
	"My wife doesn't want to go on work that day, and my daughter said her school disappeared.",
	"It's hard to imagine that such a large school would disappear.",
	"But it happened. Her school used to be in the countryside, and was one of the best school in our city.",
	"When I went there, nothing left. It's not dismantled, but simply... disappeared.",

	"I thought it was only a joke, a Halloween joke. Like... Silent Hill theme Halloween party?",

	"And never woke up until she became a Matchstick man and vanished.",
	"Since then, the world was in a mess.",
	"More and more people disappeared without any message, skyscrapers became smaller and even became wooden house.",
	"I've seen nobody for almost a year, until I met you.",
	"I prayed to the god that if someone could save us... Maybe you’re the right one.",
	"I don’t have so much time I think... I’m also a Matchstick man now, and would disappear someday in the future.",
