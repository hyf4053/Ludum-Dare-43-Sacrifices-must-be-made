	"However, I'm afraid that you can't do anything by now... You came at a wrong time.",
	"Not a wrong time, but... I really missed the time before.",
	"When we have a better world.",
	"I can't remember how long has it been since then... At that time, we owned almost all we want.",
	"Houses, jobs, entertainment... I really enjoyed my life, so do others.",
	"I used to be a worker... Not so fun, eh? But believe me, I was found of that.",
	"I have my wife, my dear daughter, and our cute cat. It's a lazy cat, but is even more hardworking than me sometimes.",
	"But one day, when I woke up in the morning, something changes, I mean, slowly changes.",
	"My wife doesn't want to go on work that day, and my daughter said her school disappeared.",
	"It's hard to imagine that such a large school would disappear.",
	"But it happened. Her school used to be in the countryside, and was one of the best school in our city.",
	"When I went there, nothing left. It's not dismantled, but simply... disappeared.",
	"I can see nothing there, even the sky. Something invisible blocked my way.",
	"I thought it was only a joke, a Halloween joke. Like... Silent Hill theme Halloween party?",
	"The whole city used to decorate the environment like Silent Hill in order to celebrate the Halloween.",
	"I told myself the school will be here another day and went home, my wife was still sleeping.",
	"And never woke up until she became a Matchstick man and vanished.",
	"Since then, the world was in a mess.",
	"More and more people disappeared without any message, skyscrapers became smaller and even became wooden house.",
	"I've seen nobody for almost a year, until I met you.",
	"I prayed to the god that if someone could save us... Maybe you’re the right one.",
	"I don’t have so much time I think... I’m also a Matchstick man now, and would disappear someday in the future.",
	"Please find out what happened to our city, and save it, please.",
	"I don’t wanna see the city I grew up became such a weird and poor place..."],
